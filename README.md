------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Training as a developer has improved my systematic problem solving abilities, and I am seeking an exciting junior developer role in an innovative environment to support my learning and growth as a developer.

For as long as I can remember I've always had a fascination for software development. I have transitioned from a job in a primary special school to web development, and undertaken an immersive 12 week bootcamp at Makers Academy.

I have learned a lot from working in education, including how to work efficiently with colleagues in many different roles and be creative to allow children with a range of special educational needs to access the curriculum. I have seen the positive impact technology can have in an educational environment. During my time there, the school embraced technology for data collection and analysis, tracking pupils’ progress, and sharing information. Having more streamlined processes allowed us to dedicate additional time to helping the children.

## Skills

#### Communication
I enjoy working in teams, and good communication within a team is essential for productivity and my happiness in the workplace.
Since being at Makers I have used Slack to regularly communicate with some of my colleagues and also my mentor. Slack has allowed me to communicate clearly what I am working on each day and has been an important part of my workflow.

I developed strong communication skills during my time working in primary education. It was vital to demonstrate clear, concise communication with both children and adults. I had to be creative and flexible in my approach to communicating with children with special needs, and was often praised for my ability to do so. We used our weekly team meetings to discuss our children’s needs and troubleshoot any problems we were experiencing in helping them meet their targets.


#### Quick learner

I relish the opportunity to learn and try new things, not just in programming but in all aspects of life. I find that I learn best by doing. I have learned a lot from creating new projects, always approaching these with a sense of optimism and a can-do attitude. This was particularly evident during a  Javascript course at Birkbeck University, when I decided to build my own form and add some advanced functionality to it. I'm a strong believer in having a growth mindset, as i’ve found new skills can be developed through dedication and hard work.

I keep myself organised by maintaining my daily task list on Trello. I feel this helps me to stay on top of my work, leading to better outcomes overall.

#### Able to motivate others
I have a proven record of motivating others, as an athletics coach working with some of the most talented athletes in the Highgate Harriers Athletics Club. I have coached young athletes to Regional, National and European Championship level, where they won medals and titles across a range of disciplines. Alongside supporting others to succeed, I have motivated myself to beginning my coding studies in my spare time, working around the long hours of being an athletics coach and a classroom assistant.
