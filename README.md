------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Training as a developer has improved my systematic problem solving abilities, and I am seeking an exciting junior developer role in an innovative environment to support my learning and growth as a developer.

For as long as I can remember I've always had a fascination for software development. I have transitioned from a job in a primary special school to web development, and undertaken an immersive 12 week bootcamp at Makers Academy.

I have learned a lot from working in education, including how to work efficiently with colleagues in many different roles and be creative to allow children with a range of special educational needs to access the curriculum. I have seen the positive impact technology can have in an educational environment. During my time there, the school embraced technology for data collection and analysis, tracking pupils’ progress, and sharing information. Having more streamlined processes allowed us to dedicate additional time to helping the children.

## Skills

#### Communication
I enjoy working in teams, and good communication within a team is essential for
productivity and happiness in the workplace. At Makers, I have used Slack to regularly communicate with colleagues, coaches and my mentor, and found this to be an important part of my workflow. I developed strong communication skills working in special education, where clear, concise communication was vital.

#### Quick learner

I relish opportunities to learn , not just in programming but
in all aspects of life. I find that I learn best by doing. I have learned a lot from creating new projects, always approaching these with an optimistic can-do attitude. I'm a strong believer in having a growth mindset;
new skills can be developed through dedication and hard work.
I maintain a daily task list on Trello, which helps me to stay organised and leads to better outcomes.

#### Able to motivate others

I have a proven record of motivating others, as coach for some of the most talented athletes in the Highgate Harriers Athletics Club. 

I lead by example: I dedicated myself to studying programming in my spare time, around a full-time job in education and evening and weekend coaching commitments.
